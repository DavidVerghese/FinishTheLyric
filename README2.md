# Finish The Lyric

# App Title
Finish the Lyric

# App Description 

I want to create a quiz where users guess the last word in a famous song lyric. I'd like to include images and sound effects, as well.

# API

I'm using this API: https://lyricsovh.docs.apiary.io/#

```json
{
    "lyrics": "Imagine there's no heaven\r\nIt's easy if you try\r\nNo hell below us\r\nAbove us only sky\r\nImagine all the people\r\nLiving for today... \n\n\n\nImagine there's no countries\n\nIt isn't hard to do\n\nNothing to kill or die for\n\nAnd no religion too\n\nImagine all the people\n\nLiving life in peace... \n\n\n\nYou may say I'm a dreamer\n\nBut I'm not the only one\n\nI hope someday you'll join us\n\nAnd the world will be as one \n\n\n\nImagine no possessions\n\nI wonder if you can\n\nNo need for greed or hunger\n\nA brotherhood of man\n\nImagine all the people\n\nSharing all the world... \n\n\n\nYou may say I'm a dreamer\n\nBut I'm not the only one\n\nI hope someday you'll join us\n\nAnd the world will live as one"
}

# MVP

The Minimum Viable Product would be a website that can pull short snippets of lyrics from famous songs. It would have a multiple choice quiz, where users can pick what they think the last word is. It would display relevant pictures. For example, a question about what comes after "Just a city boy/ born and raised in south..." would display a picture of the band Journey. It would have a sound effect for if the user picked the right answer, and one for if the user picked the wrong answer. At the end of the quiz, the user will recieve a score, and a ranking (eg: "music trivia expert", "music ignoramous"). 

# Post MVP

I'd like to add in sound effects. I also might add a "host" that talks to the user. Eg, it might send a message like, "Wrong one, Alex", or "On a roll, Alex", based on the user's name and how they are doing. 

# Goals

Day 1: Work on retrieving information from the API and getting it to display on the webpage. Fix a problem I'm currently having with the API where it only returns data the first time I call it.
Day 2: Research song lyric quizes, game shows, and consider what features to implement. Get data from the API to display on the screen. Work on creating a multiple choice option with HTML,JavaScript,CSS. 
Day 3: Review Flexbox and CSS. Work on adding pictures and styling them with Flexbox and CSS. 
Day 4: Write some more text for the quiz. Continue working on adding pictures and styling them with Flexbox and CSS. Get feedback from people I know on this project.
Day 5: Work on tracking the final score the user recieves. Try to implement user feedback from yesterday.
Day 6: Work on adding in sound effects. Work on debugging the code.
Day 7: Work on cleaning up the code. Test project to make sure it works, including on mobile.
